# Creating a new game #
#######################
  - Someone clicks button to create lobby
      - show code
      - allow people to join by inputting the instance code
        - input name
        - select team
    - at least 4 total players -> allow leader to hit "begin"
      1. generate two Board objects
        - create a Card object for each slot in the board
      2. generate a Team for each team
      3. generate Game
      4. generate GameInstance
        - generate an empty ScoreCard
        - use the code as the instance_id
        - use TEAM1_TURN as status
        - use voting mode decided from earlier
        - use guess_timeout decided from earlier
        - use game generated in previous step
      5. Write instance

# Round play #
##############
  - for the appropriate team (round % 2 to determine which team goes first)...
    1. generate a new code
    2. determine which player should be giving the hint
    3. START TIMER 1
    4. accept codemaster's hint
    (timer stop)
    5. START TIMER 2
    6. accept both team's guesses
    (timer stop)
    7. determine if an interception token should be awarded
    8. determine if a miscommunication token should be awarded
  - check for win condition
  - increment the round counter

############
# Game end #
############
  - show "win" screen for relevant team
  - distinguish between interception win and miscommunication win


##############################
# Other features to consider #
##############################
  - Allow captains to pause the game?
  - Make "win condition" a variable
  - Allow separate timers for hinting and guessing
  - Allow game creator to choose word set
    - Think about supporting custom word sets
  - Allow game creator to choose number of words on each board (default 4, allow 3, 4, 5)
  - Allow game creator to choose between "dictator" or "democracy" mode (captain chooses final answer, or it goes to a vote)
  - Allow game creator to choose the time limit for giving hints
  - Security: don't allow other players to spoof responses
    - Introduce concept of ViewerContext
